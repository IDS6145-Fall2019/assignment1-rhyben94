# Assignment 1 - Designing Models and Analyzing Data (Template)

> * Participant name: Rhyse Bendell
> * Project Title: HW1

# General Introduction

The first part of this assignment explores designing models (and basic Python/Git features). 

We will look at **subway model in a city** system. A **subway system** is an underground, tube, or metro, underground railway system used to transport large numbers of passengers within urban and suburban areas - modern subways use different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. 

The second part of the assignment explores data analysis. Data analysis and visualization is key to both the input and output of simulations. This assignment explores different random number generators, distributions, visualizations, and statistics. Additionally, it will look at getting you accustomed to specifying input and output variables to a system. We will also practice working with real data.

# Part 1: Designing a Model - Subway System

Mass transit is already a vital component for cities hosting large populations, and as populations continue to increase the importance of optimizing the capability of transit systems will only increase. Although the potential for remote work opportunities may somewhat mitigate the demand for mass transit options, the reality of climate change and the cost of personal transportation (vehicles, road maintanence, fuel transport, repair, etc.) will necessitate expansion of mass transit systems: the more we can understand about their design and use now may help to reduce negative reactions to the transition to reliance on mass transit such as subways and trains.

Some nations have already begun to feel the strain of populations that have grown beyond the capabilities of mass transit. Many videos captured in Japan and portions of China show passengers literally packed into underground transport cars by the force of several individuals, and while those snapshots may be amusing from the outside that discomfort is not a far off reality for cities such as New York or Washington D.C.

The problem of human transportation is, of course, not a new one, and with the rapid technological advancements witnessed in the last century we may be equipped to handle developing challenges. While engineers work to achieve game-changing tech such as bullet trains and their ilk, it is up to researchers on the human-factors and modeling side of the equation to explore how best to leverage any new and existing systems. Fortunately, we exist in an age of data abundance: models and simulations which previously may have been based on speculation, or a single researcher's afternoon at the stairs of the Tube may now be replaced by empirical data regarding passaenger loads, behaviors, preferences, and more which can inform models which may be used to improve both the structural and social engineering associated with our transit technologies.

## (Part 1.1): Requirements (Experimental Design) **(10%)**

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic a Subway escalator. What exactly does that mean - practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define problems cities face and hypothesize how a subway system could help alleviate these issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

IDS6145: Requirements Definition

**What is the Userâ€™s Need? **
At the highest level, the need of individuals utilizing the subway system is to get from point A to point B. Although it may not be the highest priority of all users, it seems reasonable to assume that minimizing the time in transit is a shared goal of the majority. 

![HighLevel](images/Subway-HighLevelRequirements.PNG)

Arguably, additional requirements could be considered such as comfort (e.g., the situation during rush hour during Japan may have developed to be culturally acceptable, but would probably discomfort most Westerners), lack of effort, and cost. Specifically, with regards to the escalators that lead to and from the subway cars a users needs may be generalized as: rate of access to transit, social comfort/human proximity, and reduction of effort (i.e. not having to walk). 

**What is the Simuland?**
Considering the Subway escalator problem, the system that needs to be simulated is not just the action of the escalators themselves, but also the flux of individuals passing through (rather, up and down) the escalators. The particular components that may be most relevant to such a simulation include the rate of passenger entrance from both ends of an escalator section (assuming that space in the subtending spaces has a limited capacity), the length of the escalators (could be operationalized as the rate at which passengers are passively transported from Onboard-->Offload), the number of people that can be packed onto any given escalator, the number of escalators available for exit or entry,and the ability of passengers to engage in active translation.

![HighLevel](images/EscalatorSimuland.PNG)

Including such variables in the simulated model allows for a several easily accesible "experiments." The entry and exit rates provide easy access to analysis of factors such as lull and rush periods as well as potential comparability between structural subway system designs that intentionally limit or promote passenger flow at either end. The characteristics of the modeled escalators themselves may additionally be modified: the number of passengers that can be accomodated by any given escalator, number of escalators, and passive translation rates for instance may provide insight into activiation patterns that may be appropriate for given entry/exit rates. 


**What needs to be learned about it? **
Naturally, this portion of any modeling approach is purely arbitrary: the only things that need to be learned about anything are what one wants to learn. The context of optimizing passenger transit in an overly populated society may drive a few desired learning objectives such as determining the maximum number of passengers that may be translated by a given existing system, the ideal escalator activation patterns (i.e., number dedicated to entry versus exit) to support optimum flow at a given set of passenger exit and entry rates, the optimum physical design of escalators to maximize passengers while maintaining safety (it could be that wider escalators with shallower steps could benefit max passenger levels, though there are mechanical considerations that may pose problems), or even the ideal behaviors of passengers that most benefits overall translation (e.g., the "please just stand" request discussed in IDS6145).

**What are the measures of effectiveness to be produced?**
Taking the examples given above, the relevant metrics follow from the questions themselves: maximum number of passengers may be quantified as precisely that, a count of passengers, whereas something more abstract such as ideal behavior may yield a measure of effectiveness that is dependent on several metrics such as passenger count per relevant epoch, overall passenger comfort, and average passenger satisfaction (it may be that the majority of passengers prefer to engage in active translation, and that a purely passive translation system may optimize passenger count but reduce overall satisfaction).

* Write up a paragraph that describes the data and how it fits into your system.
* Load the data into Python
* Calculate a few useful statistic on the data - keep it simple- STD, means, etc..., this is just designed * to get used to working with real data. Explain the insights you derive from these statistics.
* Visualize the raw data - visualize a few critical aspects of the data to better describe what it is, what it is showing, and why its useful to your system.
* Calculate and plot some summary statistics that better describe the data.

## (Part 3.2) -  Plotting 2D Random Number Generators **(15%)**

This portion of the assignment looks at generating random numbers in Python and understanding how to properly plot them. Plot two different random numbers, pseudo random and quasi random, for five different N values. There should be 10 subplots, all properly formatted 2D plots. Note, each of the N points will have two coordinates, an x and a y, therefore you will need to generate two random numbers for each point. You should replace the image with your results in a simalar format. Discuss how the patterns differ. Feel free to change the N values from the suggested N values in the image to state your case.

## (Part 3.3) -  Plotting 1D Random Distributions **(15%)**

Now, choose three different distributions to plot in 1D, or as a histogram. Choose a pseudo-random generator and generate three different distributions. Example distributions are Uniform (part 8), Normal, Exponential, Poisson, and Chi-Squared, but feel free to use any three distributions of your choice. Again, plot each distribution for five different Ns. This will result in 15 different subplots, formatted similar to the image in Part 8. Include your properly formmated 1D plots below and breifly describe what we are looking at and how things change as N is changed.

Repeat the above using a quasi-random generator. Discuss the similarities and differences.
